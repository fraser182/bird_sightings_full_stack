# Lab: Full Stack Application Refactor

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the data flow through a full stack application
- Be able to make a post request from a front-end application and persist the data in a database

## Introduction

You have been given an existing application that allows bird watchers to keep a record the species, dates and locations of bird sightings. The functionality that allows the user to save their sighting is not yet complete. Your task is to complete it.

## Task

### MVP

- The webpage should display a list of all the saves bird sightings.
- Create index, show and delete routes in createRouter.js 

### Extension

- Implement the functionality that allows a users to submit the form and for their bird sighting to be persisted so they can view their sightings at a late date. 

## Planning

Identify which files in the application you are going to need to modify and how you are going to test each modification as you go.

One approach you could take when Pair Programming is for one to drive the front-end and swap for the back-end
